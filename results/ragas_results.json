      "4.3 SUPERVISORY ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES The responsibilities of the supervisory team are to: \u2022undertake regular supervisory development to enhance supervisory skills and knowledge and maintain sufficient knowledge of the research area and research skills \u2022be accountable for reporting on progression of their PGRs to the Faculty Research Degrees Committee (FRDC) and to raise any issues \u2022understand the regulatory framework underpinning postgraduate research at BU and to ensure their PGRs adhere to all PGR related policies, referring to those outlined in Section 1.3.1 and in the rest of this CoP 8A Code of Practice for Research Degrees 202 4-25 Policy, Procedure and Guidelines 19 \u2022 guide the PGR in planning a research project, provide clear guidance on the key monitoring milestones and provide constructive and timely response to written work (normally within three weeks, unless otherwise agreed) and approve the record of supervisory meetings \u2022 maintain regular contact with their PGR,",
      "Prior to enrolment, all PGRs are appointed a supervisory team which: \u2022will comprise a minimum of two supervisors: othe first supervisor must be a BU member of staff othe second, or subsequent supervisor(s), may be either a BU member of staff or external oat least one supervisor must hold a doctorate, normally the BU member of staff oat least one supervisor must have previously successfully supervised at the appropriate level from enrolment through to completion or one entire research degree cycle (at any HEI) \u2022will have expertise in the relevant subject or discipline area of research and knowledge of those methodologies and skills required for the research \u2022may also include an external supervisor as a subject or methodology specialist, but not as the first supervisor.",
      "This is of particular relevance for Professional Doctorates where the additional input of Professional Practice experience is required \u2022may include a member of visiting academic staff, however, their eligibility to supervise should be discussed with their DD(R) \u2022will engage in supervisory development every 3 years. In appointing supervisory teams, the faculty should be mindful of the diversity, equality, and inclusivity balance of individual teams, where possible, and across the department and faculty as whole. Supervisors are not normally expected to supervise more than 6 full -time PGRs, or equivalent, as the first supervisor. 4.2 SUPERVISORY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST All supervisors, both internal and external, have a duty to make an appropriate declaration where there are personal conflicts of interest with other members of the supervisory team, or with the PGR.",
      "To avoid any conflict of interest, members of a supervisory team must not: \u2022be related to, or be in a personal relationship with, other members of the supervisory team \u2022supervise relatives, partners or others with whom they have a close personal relationship Exceptionally, and at the discretion of the Faculty DD(R), a member of BU staff, who themselves are registered for a research degree, may be part of a supervisory team where they bring expertise that is not available elsewhere. In such cases, the individual may not the first supervisor and there should be no other conflicts of interest.",
      "4.5 SUPERVISORY DEVELOPMENT All supervisors are required to engage in continuing professional development by undertaking supervisory development activities every 3 years. Working closely with the Faculties, the Doctoral College provides a number of supervisory development opportunities which are reviewed regularly to ensure they meet the needs of supervisors and reflect the shifting challenges in the research degree environment. It is mandatory that all those new to research degree supervision engage in the one -day New Supervisor Development session normally prior to joining a supervisory team to: \u2022provide them with the understanding of relevant internal and external regulatory frameworks \u2022understand the different supervisory styles \u2022develop knowledge of the internal policies and processes required to supervise PGRs at BU.",
      "It is expected the initial supervisory meeting will contain discussion on appropriate methods for documenting the practice -led process sufficient to justify the award at examination. It is also expected the supervisory team and the PGR should agree a timetable for certain stages of the practical element. The probationary review may need to address different questions than those posed for other research degrees.",
      "Such concerns may include failure of the supervisory team to: \u2022meet with the PGR regularly \u2022provide appropriate and meaningful feedback and guidance during supervisory meetings \u2022provide appropriate, meaningful and timely written feedback on written outputs from the research. Wherever possible the PGR should discuss any concerns with their supervisory team in the first instance. If this does not bring about an improvement, the PGR should discuss concerns with their Departmental PGR Lead (or equivalent) who should aim to resolve the situation informally. If there are exceptional circumstances which make it difficult to come to an informal resolution, the DD(R) may need to become involved in the discussion in order to ensure the most appropriate outcome for all parties. It should be noted that there may be some circumstances where a supervisor is intrinsically linked to a specific project and cannot be removed from the supervisory team.",
      "It is essential the PGR is involved in this process and supervisory team will be expected to review and comment on all such progress reports. 4.4 DEPARTURE AND ABSENCE OF A SUPERVISOR If a supervisor leaves the University, or is absent for a significant period (i.e., more than one term), it is the responsibility of the faculty to ensure alternative and appropriate supervisory team arrangements are put in place for the PGR. Changes to supervision may also occur because of a change in the direction of the project or other reasons. Requests for changes to supervisors should be made to the faculty. It should be noted that there may be some circumstances where a supervisor is intrinsically linked to a specific project and cannot be removed from the supervisory team.",

      "The academic standards required at each level are stated in the National Qualification Descriptors for Master\u2019s (M) Level and Doctoral (D) Level degree (set out in Appendices 4 and 5). The eligibility criteria for enrolment on to a research degree are set out in the Standard Admissions Regulations: Research Degrees .

All aspects of the submission should follow those set out in Section 12.1. Presentation of the thesis should follow the guidelines set out in Chapter 13. Assessment of MPhil PGRs mirrors that set out in Section 12.3 and assessment will consist of two stages: presentation of the thesis and the viva voce examination. All must be completed to the satisfaction of the two examiners, one of whom must be external (two externals if the PGR is a BU member of staff), and who will be appointed following procedures set out in Section 5.1.1.",

Similarly, the supervisors should also provide a rationale, outlining their reservations about the thesis in its current form, or other pertinent information. These statements will not be shared with the examining team. Normally the PGR must submit the following to the PGRA well in advance of any proposed examination date: \u2022one electronic copy in PDF format of the thesis, including the abstract, and a completed copy of the PGR's Declaration on ProGRess.

    "user_input":"What distinguishes practice-led research from other research types?",
    "retrieved_contexts":[
      "Practice -led research is a proven method of inquiry in which the contribution to knowledge and understanding is embedded in practice. There is a fundamental difference between \u201cpractice\u201d and \u201cpractice undertaken as part of a research programme\u201d. Most practitioners undertake research as part of their practice, but this research is very often focussed on realising a specific practical goal without communicating the findings of the research to others. In some areas of traditional research, the aim is similarly to meet a specific practical objective. The distinctive nature of practice -led research is however that the researcher\u2019s practice is fundamental to the journey of investigation with the aim of rendering significant aspects of the practice process communicable to add to humanity\u2019s shared knowledge and understanding.",
      "Practice -led researchers make original contributions to the store of knowledge about their discipline through a rigorous investigation of practice. This research is both initiated in practice and then pursued through practice. This commitment to place practice at the centre of the design, conduct and reporting of practice -led research separates it from conventional research approaches. BU recognises that while the outcomes of practice -led research can parallel the range of outcomes found in many different academic approaches, the presentation of those outcomes differentiate practice -led research from other approaches. As such, the outcome (or thesis) is defined as a practical element and an exegesis, which addresses, elucidates and contextualises the work, and which will be examined as an integrated whole.",
      "BU also recognises that the nature of the practice -led research may require flexibility in the approach to monitoring, progression and examination and this section sets out to clarify where and how this may differ. This section provides those undertaking a practice -led research degree, their supervisors and examiners with information, guidance and advice. It sets out the regulations and arrangements in place for undertaking a practice -led research degree (Master or Doctor of Philosophy). In all aspects of these arrangements, where appropriate, they should align with those arrangements already in place for the other research degrees to ensure parity of standards. 10.10.2. Principles of Practice -Led Research Practice -led research is defined by the process undertaken and not by the form of the finished element. The goal of all research is to add to the store of knowledge and understanding.",
      "\u201cPractice -Led\u201d Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The PhD involves a more complex and advanced project and is awarded to a PGR who, having critically investigated and evaluated an approved topic, resulting in an independent and original contribution to knowledge and demonstrated an understanding of research methods appropriate to the chosen field, has presented and defended a practical element and accompanying exegesis, by viva voce examination, to the satisfaction of the examiners. The fundamental principle of a practice -led research degree is the same as that of other research degrees and so a PGR for a practice -led research degree must also follow this CoP. However, the nature of the practice -led research may require flexibility in the approach to monitoring, progression and examination.",
      "As such those embarking on a practice -led research degree should be advised to consider: \u2022the planned practice -led research project - the project planned for examination, the scope and scale of the project, when and where the research will be undertaken \u2022the context and rationale for the research project - indicate the \u2018enthusiasms of practice\u2019 and\/or the \u2018necessity for practice\u2019 that are informing the project and outline the larger theoretical landscapes which inform the practice \u2022the methodology or practicalities behind the practice -led research project - account for the broad paradigms (cultural, aesthetic or philosophical frameworks) that are informing both the research and the researcher, explain the techniques and strategies of practice used to document research \u2022any collaboration - explain what IP and copyright arrangements are in place, representing and reporting knowledge claims \u2013 balancing the practice -led output with the exegesis \u2022the costing of the practice -led research",
      "The practice -led research degree must: \u2022 define a series of research questions or problems that will be addressed during the research \u2022 define its objectives in terms of seeking to enhance knowledge and understanding relating to the questions or problems to be addressed \u2022 specify a research context for the questions or problems to be addressed \u2022 specify why it is important that these questions or problems should be addressed, what other research is being or has been conducted in this area and what contribution this project will make to the advancement of creativity, insights, practice, knowledge and understanding in this area \u2022 specify the research methods for addressing and answering the research questions or problems.",
      "As such, it is important that supervisor\/PGR relations allow time to define the specific issues raised by practice -led research in the specific area of enquiry, to establish a shared vocabulary, to identify what is invariant in practice and to initiate the PGR into the practice\/research debate. For example, in creative practice, process and method can be emergent following periods of experimentation and critical reflection and motivation for the research could have arisen around \u2018an enthusiasm of practice\u2019 rather than from a commonly recognised problem or question to be answered. However, practice -led research can be used when it is the only way to answer a particular question\/s. The framework agreed between PGR and supervisory team should not be viewed as prescriptive.",
      "both the research and the researcher, explain the techniques and strategies of practice used to document research \u2022any collaboration - explain what IP and copyright arrangements are in place, representing and reporting knowledge claims \u2013 balancing the practice -led output with the exegesis \u2022the costing of the practice -led research The PGR should undertake a contextual review which includes the literature but also influential practitioners, periods and works. This may not come early in the process. Materials and methods are likely to arise from the \u2018techniques and strategies of practice\u2019 and will be used to document the research. For PGRs wishing to submit for a practice -led PhD, the process and outcome of the Major Review should parallel that of other research degrees.",
      "8A Code of Practice for Research Degrees 202 4-25 Policy, Procedure and Guidelines 50 During the research project, how to answer the questions, or advance available knowledge and understanding of the problems must be shown. It should also explain the rationale for the chosen research methods and why they provide the most appropriate means by which to answer the research questions. Contributions of practice -led research may include: \u2022 the realisation of new design solutions \u2022 aesthetic development \u2022 new subject specific methods or techniques \u2022 generic methodological innovation \u2022 new understanding of practice -led processes \u2022 new models of practice \u2022 new theoretical development \u2022 new critical positioning of praxis \u2022 new knowledge that could only have been created through practice. 10.10.3.",
      "For a practice -led research degree, this must include: \u2022 the practical element (including a permanent record) possibly, but not limited to, an artefact, performance or exhibition, which must have been undertaken as part of the research programme \u2022 appropriate good quality documentation of both the practical process and the finished element. Outputs for practice -led research may take any number of forms, may be ephemeral and may depend heavily on unpredictable audience interaction. Research has been evidenced, for example, through outputs on permanent public display, community schemes, temporary exhibitions, performances and forms that are experienced by the public and are then published, critiqued and publicised through various media. However, though the practical element of the thesis may be temporary or transitory in nature, good quality documentation of the completed practical element must be included in the submission.",
      "It is a tool that allows supervisors to assess progress and a safeguard to ensure that material exists that will allow the thesis element and exegesis to be judged by appropriate examiners. It is expected that practitioners engaged in critical research will see goals and methodologies change, and it is important that these changes are consistently documented. 10.10.5. Process The process for undertaking a practice -led research degree must align as far as possible with that set out for other research degrees. However, it is acknowledged that these \u2018key milestones\u2019 often impair progression for they impose the protocols of problem -led research on practice -led researchers. As such, in addition to the requirements stipulated in this CoP, PGRs developing practice -led research are also expected to provide appropriate evidence of progress with their practical element.",
      "In addition, the examining team of a practice -led research degree should normally have prior experience of similar works and may also include an active practitioner or professional who is not an academic. The role of the examiners must follow the standard guidance. As with other research degrees, the assessed work should demonstrate an independent and original contribution to knowledge and an understanding of relevant research methods. The purpose of the practical element is to provide a coherent demonstration that the PGR has achieved the intentions of the research programme and in doing so has made a substantial original contribution to the discipline. In the case of the practice -led research degree, the new knowledge is represented or embodied within the practical work and its accompanying exegesis. The assessment will include independent examination of the \u201cthesis\u201d followed by a viva voce examination.",
      "Mode of Learning The following practice -led research degrees are awarded to PGRs who successfully complete the following approved programmes of supervised research, on a full or part -time basis, at BU: \u201cPractice -Led\u201d Master\u2019s by Research (MRes) The MRes is awarded to a PGR who, having completed a programme of study which includes the development of generic research knowledge and skills applied to independent research on an approved topic, has presented and defended a practical element and accompanying exegesis, by viva voce examination, to the satisfaction of the examiners. \u201cPractice -Led\u201d Master of Philosophy (MPhil) The MPhil is awarded to a PGR who, having critically investigated and evaluated an approved topic and demonstrated an understanding of research methods appropriate to the chosen field, has presented and defended a practical element and accompanying exegesis, by viva voce examination, to the satisfaction of the examiners."

    "response":"Practice-led research is distinguished from other research types by its fundamental integration of practice in both the inquiry process and its outcomes. While traditional research often focuses on achieving specific practical goals without necessarily communicating findings, practice-led research embeds its contribution to knowledge within the practice itself. It is characterized by the researcher's ongoing practice throughout the investigation, aiming to render significant aspects of that practice communicable and to contribute to collective knowledge and understanding (Context 1). \n\nFurthermore, practice-led research emphasizes the process of practice as central to the research design, conduct, and reporting. The outcomes are not just academic results; they include a practical element and an accompanying exegesis that contextualizes the work, making the presentation of these outcomes unique compared to conventional research approaches (Context 2). Overall, the core distinction lies in its commitment to intertwine practice and research throughout the entire process (Context 6).",

    "retrieved_contexts":[
      "Practice -led research is a proven method of inquiry in which the contribution to knowledge and understanding is embedded in practice. There is a fundamental difference between \u201cpractice\u201d and \u201cpractice undertaken as part of a research programme\u201d. Most practitioners undertake research as part of their practice, but this research is very often focussed on realising a specific practical goal without communicating the findings of the research to others. In some areas of traditional research, the aim is similarly to meet a specific practical objective. The distinctive nature of practice -led research is however that the researcher\u2019s practice is fundamental to the journey of investigation with the aim of rendering significant aspects of the practice process communicable to add to humanity\u2019s shared knowledge and understanding.",
      "Practice -led researchers make original contributions to the store of knowledge about their discipline through a rigorous investigation of practice. This research is both initiated in practice and then pursued through practice. This commitment to place practice at the centre of the design, conduct and reporting of practice -led research separates it from conventional research approaches. BU recognises that while the outcomes of practice -led research can parallel the range of outcomes found in many different academic approaches, the presentation of those outcomes differentiate practice -led research from other approaches. As such, the outcome (or thesis) is defined as a practical element and an exegesis, which addresses, elucidates and contextualises the work, and which will be examined as an integrated whole.",
      "In addition, the examining team of a practice -led research degree should normally have prior experience of similar works and may also include an active practitioner or professional who is not an academic. The role of the examiners must follow the standard guidance. As with other research degrees, the assessed work should demonstrate an independent and original contribution to knowledge and an understanding of relevant research methods. The purpose of the practical element is to provide a coherent demonstration that the PGR has achieved the intentions of the research programme and in doing so has made a substantial original contribution to the discipline. In the case of the practice -led research degree, the new knowledge is represented or embodied within the practical work and its accompanying exegesis. The assessment will include independent examination of the \u201cthesis\u201d followed by a viva voce examination.",

This may not come early in the process. Materials and methods are likely to arise from the \u2018techniques and strategies of practice\u2019 and will be used to document the research. For PGRs wishing to submit for a practice -led PhD, the process and outcome of the Major Review should parallel that of other research degrees.",
      "BU also recognises that the nature of the practice -led research may require flexibility in the approach to monitoring, progression and examination and this section sets out to clarify where and how this may differ. This section provides those undertaking a practice -led research degree, their supervisors and examiners with information, guidance and advice. It sets out the regulations and arrangements in place for undertaking a practice -led research degree (Master or Doctor of Philosophy). In all aspects of these arrangements, where appropriate, they should align with those arrangements already in place for the other research degrees to ensure parity of standards. 10.10.2.

Outputs for practice -led research may take any number of forms, may be ephemeral and may depend heavily on unpredictable audience interaction. Research has been evidenced, for example, through outputs on permanent public display, community schemes, temporary exhibitions, performances and forms that are experienced by the public and are then published, critiqued and publicised through various media. However, though the practical element of the thesis may be temporary or transitory in nature, good quality documentation of the completed practical element must be included in the submission.",
      "It is a tool that allows supervisors to assess progress and a safeguard to ensure that material exists that will allow the thesis element and exegesis to be judged by appropriate examiners. It is expected that practitioners engaged in critical research will see goals and methodologies change, and it is important that these changes are consistently documented. 10.10.5. Process The process for undertaking a practice -led research degree must align as far as possible with that set out for other research degrees. However, it is acknowledged that these \u2018key milestones\u2019 often impair progression for they impose the protocols of problem -led research on practice -led researchers. As such, in addition to the requirements stipulated in this CoP, PGRs developing practice -led research are also expected to provide appropriate evidence of progress with their practical element.",
      "As such, it is important that supervisor\/PGR relations allow time to define the specific issues raised by practice -led research in the specific area of enquiry, to establish a shared vocabulary, to identify what is invariant in practice and to initiate the PGR into the practice\/research debate. For example, in creative practice, process and method can be emergent following periods of experimentation and critical reflection and motivation for the research could have arisen around \u2018an enthusiasm of practice\u2019 rather than from a commonly recognised problem or question to be answered. However, practice -led research can be used when it is the only way to answer a particular question\/s. The framework agreed between PGR and supervisory team should not be viewed as prescriptive.",

If the PGR is registered on an MRes programme, they will be withdrawn at this point. Where the faculty panel has feedback for the PGR (normally where the Probationary period is extended), they should provide this to the PGRA within 5 working days of the faculty panel meeting who will share this with the PGR within a further 5 working days. The outcome of the Probationary Review will pass to FRDC for consideration, and if appropriate ratification, and reported to the PGR, and, via minutes, to the university\u2019s RDC.",

PGRs who are unlikely to meet the deadline must formally request an extension in writing to the PGRA prior to this deadline. The Annual Review process is as follows: The PGR should meet with the supervisory team (and Departmental PGR Lead or representative, if appropriate, for example, if there are concerns about progress or engagement) who will assess engagement and progress against the following outcomes: \u2022Excellent Progress \u2022Good Progress \u2022Satisfactory Progress \u2022Slow Progress. Where slow progress is identified, the faculty may invoke the lack of progress or lack of engagement processes. Assessment of annual progression will normally take place at faculty level.",
      "If progression review meetings identify continued lack of academic performance to an appropriate level, the faculty (normally DD(R) or nominee), will initiate the following steps: \u2022first formal letter to request evidence of appropriate progression to be made by the PGR to the satisfaction of the supervisory team (response required from the PGR within 10 working days) \u2022second formal letter to further request evidence of appropriate progression to be made by the PGR to the satisfaction of the supervisory team (response required from the PGR within 10 working days) \u2022third formal letter (Notice of Withdr awal) to inform that steps will be taken to withdraw the PGR after the 5th working day.

Those on Professiona l Doctorates , or oth er non-standa rd resea rch degrees, shoul d refer to thei r programme handbooks or seek advice from their supervis ory team regardin g any specific requirements. 10.7 CONTINUATION STATUS Continuation Status is used to define the status of doctoral students who have completed their normal period of enrolment but are still engaged in research activity or writing up until the point of submission of their thesis. Where appropriate, Continuation Status still allows these PGRs to have full access to research facilities and supervision. These PGRs will be automatically transferred to Continuation Status after 36 months full-time enrolment or 72 months of part-time study.

The length of the viva voce examination is at the discretion of the examiners but will normally take between 2 and 3 hours. The viva voce examination will normally be held online, in line with the guidelines, with the following persons present: \u2022PGR \u2022Independent chair \u2022External examiner(s) \u2022Internal examiner \u2022Supervisor(s) may also attend.

The examiners should not consult each other in the preparation of their reports. In completing the Preliminary Report, each examiner must: \u2022 consider whether the thesis provisionally satisfies the requirements of the degree \u2022 if possible, make an appropriate provisional recommendation subject to the outcome of any subsequent examination \u2022 include specific comments on o the literature review o application of research methods o literary, or other, form and presentation o the PGR\u2019s original contribution to knowledge o the extent of any collaboration o pre-viva voce examination judgement of the outcome.",

A disruption during the examination, beyond the control of any participants, will not itself be the grounds for an appeal against the procedural irregularity. 3.4 The PGR is permitted to take a hard copy of their thesis, and any supplementary notes, into the examination. They are not normally permitted to take in a laptop or other electronic devices without prior agreement. 4 Outcome of Online Viva Voce Examination 4.1 At the end of the examination, all participants should confirm that the online examination had no substantive bearing on the examination process.",
      "On return, the PGR will be informed verbally by the independent chair, or examiners, of the examiners\u2019 recommendations for the outcome of the examination. 12.3.4. Disagreement Between the Examiners Where the examiners are not in agreement about the outcome of the viva voce examination, separate reports and recommendations may be submitted to the University. In such cases, where the examiners\u2019 recommendations are not unanimous, Senate may: \u2022accept the (unanimous) recommendation of the external examiner(s) or \u2022require the appointment of an additional external examiner. Where it is required that an additional external examiner is appointed, the nomination must be undertaken independently of the supervisory team and follow the process set out in Section 5.11.

Full-time PGRs are expected to engage with their supervisory team at least once every month and record the engagement on ProGRess. Responsibility for ensuring this is actioned lies with the supervisory team. Engagement may include meeting (can be virtual) with one or more of the supervisory team, completion of a key milestone, or completion of any mandatory training (see Section 6.5). This is particularly important in relation to the monitoring attendance of PGRs in accordance with any student visa related requirements (see Section 3.1.3).",

PGRs will receive an invitation to attend the Graduation Ceremony in the year after their award has been ratified and they have received their award letter. Communication regarding graduation will be via the PGR\u2019s student email. If the PGR does not wish to attend the ceremony, they should register to graduate in absentia and their certificate will be issued after the ceremonies. In exceptional circumstances, the PGR may either request to: \u2022receive their Certificate prior to graduation or \u2022defer to the following year\u2019s Graduation Ceremony at which they will receive their certificate.",

The PGR should also check the requirements for formatting of the thesis for examination with their supervisory team or PGRAs. A PGR who has exceeded their maximum period of enrolment, or will do prior to submission and examination, will need to request an extension to enrolment. Applications should be made to the faculty via the PGRA. Each case will be considered individually and should be accompanied by supporting medical or other evidence. 12.1.2.",
