      "query": "What distinguishes practice-led research from other research types?",
      "answer": "Practice-led research is distinguished from other research types by its integration of practice as a fundamental component of the research process. Unlike conventional research, where the focus might be solely on theoretical or empirical investigation, practice-led research involves the researcher\u2019s practice as a central element of the inquiry. The outcomes of practice-led research include both a practical element and an exegesis, which together are examined as an integrated whole. This approach aims to make significant aspects of the practice process communicable, thereby contributing to humanity\u2019s shared knowledge and understanding.\n\nKey characteristics of practice-led research include:\n- The process is defined by the practice undertaken, not just the form of the finished element.\n- It involves defining research questions or problems, setting objectives to enhance knowledge and understanding, specifying a research context, and explaining the importance of addressing these questions.\n- The research methods are chosen to appropriately address and answer the research questions, with a rationale provided for their selection.\n- Contributions may include new design solutions, aesthetic developments, new methods or techniques, methodological innovations, new understandings of practice-led processes, new models of practice, theoretical developments, critical positioning of praxis, and knowledge that could only be created through practice.\n\nOverall, practice-led research at Bournemouth University requires flexibility in monitoring, progression, and examination to accommodate its distinctive nature, while ensuring parity of standards with other research degrees.",

      "answer": "Practice-led research at Bournemouth University is assessed through a combination of a practical element and an accompanying exegesis, which are examined as an integrated whole. The assessment process aligns with the standards for other research degrees, ensuring parity. The examining team for a practice-led research degree typically includes members with prior experience in similar works and may include an active practitioner or professional who is not an academic. The assessment involves an independent examination of the \"thesis\" followed by a viva voce examination.\n\nThe examiners are tasked with ensuring that the work demonstrates the following attributes:\n- Ownership of the work by the postgraduate researcher (PGR) and an appreciation of the state of knowledge within the research area.\n- A professional level of familiarity with and understanding of contemporary work in the field.\n- A sufficiently comprehensive investigation of the form and practical content.\n- Appropriate and original methods and techniques applied in the execution of the work.\n\nThe practical element is intended to demonstrate that the PGR has achieved the research programme's intentions and made a substantial original contribution to the discipline. The new knowledge is represented or embodied within the practical work and its accompanying exegesis.",
